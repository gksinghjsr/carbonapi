Changes
-------
**1.0.0-rc.2** (WIP)
   - Fix panic in case no response was received
   - Add "auto" protocol. In that mode carbonapi will do it's best to guess what to use.
   - Add "msgpack" protocol support. This protocol is used by graphite-web and metrictank.
   - Fix format for protov2
   - Fix race condition while merging requests (@gunnihinn)
   - Correctly batch metric fetching in protocol v2 (@gunnihinn)
   - Fix race condition in zipper's query cache (@Civil)
   - Update vendored dependencies
   - Fix decode for nil messages in msgpack

**1.0.0-rc.1**
   - Fix timeout sanitization logic
   - Fix empty responses for protocol/v3
   - Update vendored deps
   - Add option to configure internal route cache check interval
   - Fix PathExpression handling for protocol/v2
   - Update protocol v3 to support passing PathExpression to backend

**1.0.0-beta.2** **It's not recommended to switch to this release in production, until it's marked as stable**
   - Fix incorrect error handling in Find requests

**1.0.0-beta.1** **It's not recommended to switch to this release in production, until it's marked as stable**
   - Migrate config parsing to viper. This should give consistent expreience with carbonapi

**1.0.0-alpha.4** **It's not recommended to switch to this release until it's marked as stable**
   - [Code] Convert timestamps to int64

**1.0.0-alpha.3** **It's not recommended to switch to this release until it's marked as stable**
   - [Code] Convert timestamps back to uint32

**1.0.0-alpha.2** **It's not recommended to switch to this release until it's marked as stable**
   - [Code] Convert timestamps to be int32 (was uint32)

**1.0.0-alpha.1** **It's not recommended to switch to this release until it's marked as stable**
   - [Improvement] Major rework of load balancing logic
   - [Improvement] Support for new protobuf-based protocol that allow to pass metadata in the responses.
   - [Improvement] CarbonZipper now supports maxGlobs logic. It now will do it's best to split request into even parts of maxGlobs metrics each. Also maxGlobs=0 means "unlimited"

**0.74**
   - [Fix] Add a workaround for /info handler for zipper over zipper.
   - [Fix] Deduplicate servers in pathCache (thx. to @korsevick)
   - [Code] Refine logging
   - [Code] Improve error handling

**0.73.2**
   - [Code] Remove carbonapi cross-dependency by moving context handling code to util

**0.73**
   - **[Breaking]** [protobuf go-api] Protobuf protocol itself haven't changed, this only affects people who import carbonzipperpb package directly from this repo. Library now declares most of its structures as non-nullable. This changes API of carbonzipperpb and pb3, now they contain less pointers. That should reduce GC pressure a little bit. Sholdn't affect people who use it over the network.
   - [Improvement] Make connect timeout configurable.
   - [Improvement] Make keep alive interval configurable

**0.72**
   - [Fix] Fix /info handler (bug was introduced after splitting zipper into several packages)

**0.71**
   - [Fix] carbonsearch was not properly configured (bug introduced after splitting zipper into several packages)

**0.70**
   - **[Breaking]** Logging migrated to zap (structured logging). Log format changed significantly. Old command line options removed. Please consult example.conf for a new config options and explanations
   - **[Breaking]** Change config format from json to yaml. Also we've changed config structure and command line options. Please refer to example.conf for decent example of new format
   - [Improvement] Add context support. Also log context from carbonapi
   - [Improvement] Use dep as a vendoring tool
   - [Improvement] Add a Makefile that will hide some magic from user
   - [Improvement] graphite-web 1.0 support
   - [Fix] Fix incompatibility between carbonzipper and older versions of carbonserver/go-carbon (protobuf2-only)
   - [Code] Split carbonzipper into several packages

Notes on upgrading:

Even though there are several changes that's marked as breaking, it only breaks local config parsing and changes logging format. Please note that on high-load environments access log can be huge.

**0.63**
   - [Fix] carbonsearch query cache was never cleared

**0.62**
   - [Fix] Fix carbonsearch queries with recent carbonapi version
   - [Fix] Fix pathCache to handle render requests with globs.
   - [Feature] Add cache for carbonsearch results

**0.61**
   - [Fix] Fix rewrite for internal queries, because of an error some queries were sent as protobuf not as protobuf3
   - [Code] gofmt the code!

**0.60**
   - **[Breaking]** Carbonzipper backend protocol changed to protobuf3. Though output for /render, /info /find can be both (format=protobuf3 for protobuf3, format=protobuf for protobuf2).

**0.50**
